<h2>Bytestream</h2>
<h4>Revision: 2000.03.13 01:13 GMT+5</h4>
<br>
Bytestream is used for representing tracks data within a file. It is much like
MIDI stream.<br>
<br>
Bytestream consists of blocks corresonding to specific song time. Each block is
called EVENT and has the following structure:<br>
<br>
<pre>
EVENT {
   delta_time: 16;
   notes {
      more_notes: 1;
      note      : 7;
      commands {
         more_commands: 1;
         command      : 8;
         parambytes   : 7;
         params       : 8*parambytes;
      } until no more_commands;
   } until no more_notes;
}
</pre>
I see it pretty self-explanatory, but for those who didn't get the idea here's a brief:<br>
field sizes are in bits.<br>
<b>delta_time</b> is amount of ticks between previous and this EVENTs.<br>
<b>more_notes</b> set means that there are more notes within this EVENT.<br>
<b>note</b> is note number ranging from 0 thru 126 for C-0..F#10 and 127 indicates so-called
"global note" which is used in conjuction with commands that relate to global track effects.<br>
<b>more_commands</b> set means that there are more commands for given note.<br>
<b>command</b> is command code (see below).<br>
<b>parambytes</b> is amount of bytes taken by command parameters. This number may vary
depending on type of command and if there are some arguments omitted.<br>
<b>params</b> are parameter bytes.<br>
Size of each parameter in bytes depends on type of command and parameters it takes.<br>
