      <CENTER>The "Artistic License"</CENTER>
      <P>
      <CENTER>Preamble</CENTER>
      <P>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
      Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
      semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
      giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the
      Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
      reasonable modifications.
      <P>Definitions:
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
        through textual modification.
        <P></P>
        <LI>"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
        modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
        Copyright Holder.
        <P></P>
        <LI>"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
        copyrights for the package.
        <P></P>
        <LI>"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
        Package.
        <P></P>
        <LI>"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
        media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.
        (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but
        only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the
        fee.)
        <P></P>
        <LI>"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
        though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
        that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
        conditions they received it.
        <P></P></LI></UL>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the
      source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction,
      provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
      associated disclaimers.
      <P>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
      derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
      modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
      <P>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
      provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating
      how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE
      of the following:
      <P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or
        otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
        modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the
        modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing
        the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard
        Version of the Package.
        <P>b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
        organization.
        <P>c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
        with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
        separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
        documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
        <P>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
        <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in
      object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the
      following:
      <P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and
        library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
        equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
        <P>b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
        Package with your modifications.
        <P>c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
        Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
        non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
        pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
        Standard Version.
        <P>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
        <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any
      distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for
      support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.
      However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
      commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
      distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product
      of your own.
      <P>6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
      output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under
      the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and
      may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
      <P>7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
      shall not be considered part of this Package.
      <P>8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
      promote products derived from this software without specific prior written
      permission.
      <P>9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
      WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
      MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
