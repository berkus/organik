<h2>Terminology and designations</h2>
<h4>Revision: 2000.03.18 19:10 GMT+5</h4>
<br>
This section describes entities used to represent music inside a tracker/player
and on appropriate media. It also uncovers some problems arising when using
traditional trackers (especially in comparison with professional soft/hard).<br>
<br>

   Tempo: ticks, tacts and stamps.
   </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
Tempo is measured in BPM.

In Organik, tick represents a smallest possible time unit (TU). Its duration is
1/250th of a second. All internal calculations regarding time intervals are
carried out upon this smallest time unit.<br>
Ticks are grouped in tacts. Tact is a tempo-dependent TU. It is used for notes
and tracks operations, since this is measure of time from user's point of view.
For example, intervals between notes are measured in tacts.
Number of ticks in one tact is calculated as follows:
/ate/
Tacts are combined into stamps. Stamps are called "Speed" or "Beats per row" in
older trackers. Since ticks and even tacts are too small to handle them, it is
wise to group them into larger entities that are handy for user. Stamp defines
number of smaller TUs within one TU that is easy to manipulate.
Even then they are grouped into stamps exceptionally at user's desire. Size of
stamp is tuneable and can be adjusted personally for any portion of the song
that user composes.<br>

   Sample and sampel.
   </td>

<tr><td>
Sample is a waveform composed of arbitrary sample amplitudes at some points.
The more the number of points the better the sounding quality of the sample.
Values at points are called sampels (thanks to Chris Dragan for inventing the
word itself). Frequency at which sampels are recorded is called sampling
frequency. According to Nyquist-Kotelnikov theorem, it should be at least two
times bigger than highest frequency within sampling signal or signal loss
(also known as quantisation hiss ####) will
occur. Another important parameter is sampel resolution. Sampels may be
8/16/32/64 bits, mono/stereo/quadro, integer/fixed/floating point.<br>

   Voice parameters. Volume, pitch and position.
   </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Volume.<br>
    Volume is the loudness of the sample. Better say that its percent of
    sample's maximal amplitude. Ranging from 0 to 100 percents it uses
    logarithmic scale to implement better sound dynamics.<br>
    Volume levels encoded in 16 bits is enough to represent dynamics range of
    96dB in linear scale. This is most common amongst computer playback device,
    but definetely not the best one. It is good to encode volume in 24 bits
    with linear scale, thus giving dynamics range of XXXdB. This resolution is
    supported in superb-quality FPU mixer, which uses 32 floating point sampels
    and internal 64 bit processing to achieve best quality possible. Usual
    mixers (int/MMX) use volume precision of 12 bits with logarithmic scale.
    Ranges from 0 (not audible) through 4096 (100%).

<li>Position.<br>
    Position is a rather convenient replacement for panning in older trackers.
    It now includes two parameters to specify position within 3D listener space
    instead of simple panning.<br>Two dimensional - consists of two angles:
    azimuth and elevation. Azimuth ranges from -x (left of listener)
    through 0 (ahead of listener) through y (right of listener).
    Elevation ranges from -y (behind listener) through -z (below listener)
    through 0 (ahead of listener) through z (above listener) through
    x (almost back behind listener). In actual player position can be
    handled either as panning (elevation ignored) or taking into account
    sample phase shifts resulting from the position (best with headphones).
    Some kind of surround-like interpretation may also result from position.

<li>Pitch.<br>
    Between each two subsequent notes there are 128
    frequency levels. These levels are called pitch. The actual note frequency
    is calculated from the following formula:<br>
    freq = 8363 * 2^(((note&lt;&lt;7)+pitch)/(12*128) - 4)
