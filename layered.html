<h2>Layered instruments</h2>
<h4>Revision: 2000.04.04 14:25 GMT+5</h4>
<br>
For those of you who have already seen Reaktor - its similiar to its concept of
separate blocks (inputs/generators/filters/etc)...<br>
<br>
The main idea is to create instruments from those blocks. Even sample-based
instruments will be built out of such blocks.<br>
<br>
Blocks are divided into two types - instrument and sample processing blocks.
Instrument processing blocks operate on instrument-related entities such as
note, pitch, volume, velocity and panning. One of such blocks may be "note-pass
selector": it inputs a note issued by instrument track, checks it against
internal note mapping table and routes to appropriate sample output block,
which in turn plays some sample. This is emulation of usual note-sample mapping
table. But output of note-pass may be for example routed to pitch-pass selector
which will select an output based on pitch of the note. This architecture
allows us to create extremely sophisticated layers without writing any
scripts.<br>
<br>
Advantages:<br>
- easy creating of any layering algorithm<br>
- created hierarchy of blocks can be compiled for in-line execution without
loss for table traversing<br>
